This guide will show you how to set up a PHP app using the Slim framework and MySQL, using the Paris ORM.

This guide assumes you have:

- An Aptible account
- An SSH key associated with your Aptible user account
- The [Aptible command line tool installed](/support/topics/cli/how-to-install-cli)

## 1. Provision Your App

Tell the Aptible API that you want to provision an application. Until you push code and trigger a build, Aptible uses this as a placeholder.

Use the `apps:create` command: `aptible apps:create $APP_HANDLE`

For example:

    aptible apps:create slim-quickstart

## 2. Add a Dockerfile and a Procfile

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains the commands you would otherwise execute manually to build a Docker image. Aptible uses the resulting image to run your containers.

A Procfile explicitly declares what processes we should run for your app.

A few guidelines:

1. The files should be named "Procfile" and "Dockerfile": One word, initial capital letter, no extension.
2. Place both files in the root of your repository.
3. Be sure to commit them to version control.

Here is a sample Dockerfile for a Slim app:

    # Dockerfile
    FROM tutum/apache-php
    RUN apt-get update \
        && apt-get install -yq git wget php5-mcrypt \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    WORKDIR /app

    RUN php5enmod mcrypt

    RUN rm -fr /app
    ADD . /app
    RUN rm /var/www/html
    RUN ln -s /app /var/www/html

    RUN composer require slim/slim

    EXPOSE 80

Here is a sample Procfile for a Slim app:

    # Procfile
    web: /run.sh

## 3. Provision a Database

By default, `aptible db:create $DB_HANDLE` will provision a 10GB PostgreSQL database.

In order to specify a MySQL database, use the `--type` flag:

    aptible db:create $DB_HANDLE --type mysql

`aptible db:create` will return a connection string on success. The host value is mapped to a private subnet within your stack and cannot be used to connect from the outside Internet. Your containerized app can connect, however.

Add the database connection string to your app as an environment variable:

    aptible config:set --app slim-quickstart DATABASE_URL=$CONNECTION_STRING

To connect locally, see [the `aptible db:tunnel` command](/support/topics/cli/how-to-connect-to-database-from-outside/).

## 4. Configure a Database Connection

Add the following PHP code to your `config.php` file to extract the MySQL connection info from the `DATABASE_URL` environment config you set in step 3.

    $url = parse_url($_ENV['DATABASE_URL']);

    $host = $url["host"];
    $port = $url["port"];
    $username = $url["user"];
    $password = $url["pass"];
    $database = substr($url["path"], 1);

    ORM::configure('mysql:host=' . $host . ';port=' . $port . ';dbname=' . $database);
    ORM::configure('username', $username . '-nossl');
    ORM::configure('password', $password);

## 5. Configure a Git Remote

Add a Git remote named "aptible":

    git remote add git@beta.aptible.com:$ENVIRONMENT_HANDLE/$APP_HANDLE.git

For example:

    git remote add aptible git@beta.aptible.com:test-env/slim-quickstart.git

## 6. Deploy Your App

Make sure your code is committed, then push to the master branch of the Aptible Git remote:

    git push aptible master

Deploy logs will stream to your terminal.

## 7. Add an Endpoint

To expose your app to the Internet, you'll want to add an HTTPS Endpoint. In the Aptible dashboard, select your app, then open the "Endpoints" tab.

1. *Service:* Select the app service you want to expose (often a `web` service).
2. *Endpoint type:* The quickest option is request a default *.on-aptible.com endpoint address, which will serve the *.on-aptible.com wildcard certificate. With a custom endpoint, you provide a certificate and key for a domain of your choice.
3. *Type:* External endpoints are exposed to the Internet, meaning their endpoint addresses resolve to public IP addresses. Internal endpoints receive private IP addresses and are only routable from within your stack.
4. Save the endpoint, wait for it to provision (usually 2-15 minutes), then test the endpoint address. To test internal endpoints, you can `aptible ssh`
 into your app to spin up an ephemeral container, then `curl` your internal endpoint.

On each subsequent deploy, the Aptible platform will perform a health check on any service with an endpoint. For HTTPS Endpoints, the health check involves making an HTTP request and listening for any response. The service is considered healthy if it responds, regardless of the response status code. Deploys that fail their health checks will not be released.
