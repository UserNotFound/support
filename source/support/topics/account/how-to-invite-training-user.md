There may be instances where members of your workforce require HIPAA training, but since they are not part of your dev team, they need not have access to the Aptible Dashboard.  You can create a training-only user in order to ensure they are tracked by your compliance tools and automatically enrolled in Aptible's training program.

Navigate to your organization's settings in the Dashboard. Select "Roles," then "Create Role." Grant the new role no permissions. Go to the "Members" pane to invite users to your new role.

Advise your team to accept the new invitations and create Aptible accounts.  Once they finish they will get a follow-up invitation to Lessonly, where they will be able to complete their Basic HIPAA Privacy & Security Training.
