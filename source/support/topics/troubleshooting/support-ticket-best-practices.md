When submitting a support request to Aptible, keep the following best practices in mind:

1. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us resolve your issue quickly. When appropriate, please provide:
  - Relevant handles (app, account, database, etc.)
  - Logs or error messages 
  - The UTC timestamp when you experienced the issue
  - Any commands or configurations you have tried so far

2. Sanitize any sensitive information. This includes database connection URLs, SSH keys, passwords, tokens, and any secure environment variables you may be using. 

3. Format your support requests to make it easier to parse important information. Use backticks for monospacing or triple backticks for code blocks.  We suggest using [private GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) for long code blocks or stack traces.
