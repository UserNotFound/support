In the event that your drain appears to have stopped receiving logs, we recommend that you restart it. To do so, navigate to the Aptible dashboard and:

1. Select the environment in question.

2. Select the "Logging" tab.

3. For the affected log drain, select "Restart." 

If you do not see logs within a few minutes, [contact support](http://contact.aptible.com)
