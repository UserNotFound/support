Each Aptible endpoint uses an [AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) to provide fault-tolerant, distributed routing for the services behind it, such as your apps.

Sometimes these ELBs take several minutes to start up. If yours continues to be inaccessible, please [contact support](http://contact.aptible.com).
