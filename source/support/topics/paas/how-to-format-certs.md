This error indicates that the private key you specified does not match the certificate you specified.  To correct this problem, check that:

1. The correct key and certificates were copied over, and each to the correct entry field.

2. All characters were copied, including headers like `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`  and  `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` 

If these are correct and you are still seeing the error, [contact support](http://contact.aptible.com).
