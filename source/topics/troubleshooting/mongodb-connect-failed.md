If you are connecting to a MongoDB 3.x (the default) database on Aptible,
either through your app or running `aptible db:tunnel`, you may hit an
error looking like this:

    MongoDB shell version: 3.2.1
    connecting to: 172.17.0.2:27017/db
    2016-02-08T10:43:40.421+0000 E QUERY    [thread1] Error: network error while attempting to run command 'isMaster' on host '172.17.0.2:27017'  :
    connect@src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:226:14
    @(connect):1:6

    exception: connect failed

This error is usually caused by attempting to connect without SSL to a MongoDB
server that enforces it, which is the default on Aptible. To solve the issue,
connect to your MongoDB server over SSL.

Note that the Connection URLs generated by Aptible include the `ssl=true`
parameter, which should instruct your MongoDB client to connect over SSL. If
that's not the case, consult your client's documentation.

If you are unable to resolve the issue, contact support.
