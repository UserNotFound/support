When submitting a support request to Aptible, keep the following best practices in mind:

1. If you provide us with as much detail as possible we'll be able to troubleshoot your issue much faster.  When appropriate, please provide  

     - Relevant handles (app, account, database etc.)
     - Logs or error messages 
     - The date(s)/time(s) in UTC for when you experienced a problem

2. Sanitize any sensitive information. This includes database connection URLs, SSH keys, passwords, tokens, and any secure environment variables you may be using. 

3. We love getting formatted support requests because we're able to parse important information much easier.  Using backticks for monospacing or whole codeblocks is a great way to make information clear.  We recommend (but don't require) providing information in this format via [private github gists](https://gist.github.com/).
