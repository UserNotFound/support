When submitting a support request to Aptible, keep the following best practices in mind:

1) If you provide us with as much detail as possible we'll be able to troubleshoot your issue much faster.  When appropriate, please provide  

- Relevant handles (app, account, database etc) 
- Logs or error messages 
- The date(s)/time(s) (UTC) when you experienced a problem

2) Sanitize any sensitive information. This includes database connection URLs, SSH keys, passwords, tokens, and any secure environment variables you may be using. 

3) We love getting formatted support requests because we're able to parse important information much easier.  Using backticks for monospacing or codeblocks is a great way to make information clear. You can either send us a ticket through the Zendesk webportal or include a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) in your request.
