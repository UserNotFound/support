A log transmission issue is unlikely to occur on a production stack, but it is still possible.

In the event that your drain appears to have stopped receiving logs, we recommend that you restart it. To do so, navigate to the Aptible dashboard and:

1. Select the environment in question.

2. Click on the 'Logging' tab.

3. For the affected log drain, click 'Restart'. 

If you do not see logs flowing in a few minutes, [contact support](http://contact.aptible.com)
