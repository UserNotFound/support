There may be instances where members of your workforce require HIPAA training, but since they are not part of your dev team, they need not have access to dashboard.  You can create a training-only user in order to ensure they are tracked by your compliance tools and automatically enrolled in Aptible's training program.

From Dashboard settings, navigate to _Roles_, click _Create role_, and assign it no permissions.

In the _Members_ section, you can then invite new members to the role you've just created.   

Advise your team member to accept the new invitation and create an Aptible account.  Once they finish they will get a follow-up invitation to Lessonly, where they will be able to complete their basic training.
