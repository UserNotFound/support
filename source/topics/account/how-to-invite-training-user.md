To invite new team members to training: 

1) Create a _Training-only_ Role (if it does not yet exist)

- Dashboard => Settings => Roles => `Create role` => _No Permissions_

2) Invite members to that role

- Dashboard => Settings => Members => `Invite New Member` (assign training role)

3) Advise team ember to accept invitation and create an Aptible account.

- Once they finish creating their account, they will get a follow-up invitation into Lessonly, where they will be able to complete their basic training.
